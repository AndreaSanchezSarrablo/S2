In this repository we can find some video transfomrations, using Python and the ffmpeg library, such as cutting a video into N seconds or transforming the audio of a video from stereo to mono or viceversa.

**EXERCICES:**
Mainly we you can find 4 python scripts each one applining something to an input video.

   - **Exercici1.py:** this script asks the user for the number of seconds (N) they want from the video and returns a new video with N seconds created from the input video of the ffmpeg command.
   - **Exercici2.py:** this script is extracting the YUV histogram form the input video and then creating a new video with the orginal video and the YUV histogram of the input video during time.
   - **Exercici3.py:** this scrips is resizing the input video into 4 different outputs, the video in 720p, 480p, 360x240 and 160x120
   - **Exercici4.py:** this script is changing a stereo input audio into a mono one and viceversa, changing a mono input audio into an stereo audio.
